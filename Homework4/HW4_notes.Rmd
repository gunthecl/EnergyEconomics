# Homework 4

**Due Date**: July 24

## Task 1: Expand the model:

The cost parameters we use represent a 2050 perspective and are taken from @pape2014roadmap and @energiewende2014stromspeicher. These sources have been used in dispatch and investment modelling for storage analysis for example in @zerrahn2015greenfield. Additionally to the pumped-hydro storage, a mid-term storage option, we include a short-term storage technology, lithium-ion batteries, and a long-term option, and power-to-gas. 
Following @zerrahn2015greenfield, we assume a 22,5 lifetime for pumped-hydro storage (mean of electrolysis and reconversion lifetime).

b) 
Our csv input file ocntains the following parameters:

technology	oc_power	oc_storage	lifetime	efficiency
PSP	  1100000	  10000	80	    0.8
LITH	35000  	 150000	20	    0.92
P2G	  1700000    	200	22,5	0.38

We calculate annuity via 

annuity_oc_power = map(row-> row.oc_power * (i+1)^row.lifetime / (((1+i)^row.lifetime)-1), storage_table)
annuity_oc_energy = map(row-> row.oc_storage * (i+1)^row.lifetime / (((1+i)^row.lifetime)-1), storage_table)

In order to avoid a double charge for an investment into storages, we change the objective function to 

    @objective(Invest, Min,

        sum(mc[tech] * G[hour,tech] * 8760/length(HOUR) for tech in TECHNOLOGY, hour in HOUR)

        + sum(annuity[tech] * CAP[tech] for tech in TECHNOLOGY)
        + 0.5 * sum(annuity_oc_power[stor] * CAP_ST[stor] for stor in STOR)
        + 0.5 * sum(annuity_oc_energy[stor] * CAP_ST[stor] for stor in STOR) )


c) Run the model for shares of 70 %, 80 %, 90 %, and 100 %. Submit a plot from
the given model and one plot after you successfully implemented storages. How
does the investment into generation capacity change? What happens with the
curtailment?

- gas capacity decreases with storage for all RES shares
- largest different for 100% scenarios, capacity of onshore an offshore wind decreased strongly thorugh storage capacity
- more pv installed in storage scenarios with RES share of 70 %, 80 % , the reverse is true for 90 % and 100 % scenarios.

- For all modelled RES shares, the resulting curtailment is lower in the storage scenario compared to the no-storage case. Furthermore, curtailment in the storage scenario is drastically lower in the high RES scenarios. For the 100% RES scenario, it decreases more than 3 orders of magnitude (from 10763.3 TWh to 5.5 TWh). This is because the excess energy can be stored for later use instead of being curtailed. 

#NOTE ONLY: No storage curtailemnt: 86.9342, 199.712, 494.086, 10763.3 TWh



d) Create your own plot showing the investment into storage power and storage ca-
pacity. How much energy is stored during the course of the year? How much
energy was lost due to storage efficiency?
