# Homework 2

**Due Date**: May 28

## Task 1

a) Describe how information regarding technology and location of power plants is
implemented in the model and how, meaning with what syntax, you can access it.

Information on technology and location of power plants is fed into the model from external data that is imported from several csv files. All of these data set are load into tables, from which certain columns/rows are selected and stored in dictonaries. The information regarding technology and location of power plants is then fed into model via the dictionary "sets", which contains multiple dictionaries.

We can access information in dictonaries via indexing. For example, for inquire the technology of a given plant (P5) from the "TECH_PLANTS" dictionary, we can write 
TECH_PLANTS["P5"]. 

To find all Biomass plants within "sets" we can write 

sets["Plant_Tech"]["Biomass"]

b) 
PLANTS: Array of strings containing name of each plant
DISP: Array of strings containing name of of the subset of dispatchable plants
NONDISP: Array of strings containing name of of the subset of non-dispatchable plants
CON: Array of strings containing name of of the subset of conventional plants
RES: Array of strings containing name of of the subset of renewable plants

- Last four are all subsets of PLANTS, with DIS & NONDISP as well as CON & RES being complements. Plants are devided into  DIS and NONDISP based on dispatchability, whereas CON and RES refers to conventional and renwable plants. Differences occur due to Biomass plants, which are included in RES but are dispatchable and thus also belong to DISP.

Distinction is useful to set up constraints and objective function properly. In the objective function we minimize the sum of total costs incurred by dispatchable power plants (with nonzero marginal costs), whereas nondispatchables are not considered due to their zero marginal costs. To evaluate power generation profiles from renewables, it is useful to dinstinguish between RES and CON.

c) To calculate zonal generations, information on the zonal availability (availability), the technology type of each plant (TECH_PLANTS), maximum generation of each plant (g_max), a list of all pv and wind plants (NONDISP), as well as the location of each power plant (ZONE_PLANTS) is necessary. Based on this input, RES generation is calculated for each RES plant on an hourly basis and stored in the array g_res. This RES generation is later fed into the model as a parameter.

## Task 2
We need to add exchange variable EX, which is positive 

@variables transport_problem begin
            G[DISP, HOUR] >= 0
            G_RES[NONDISP, HOUR] >= 0
            G_stor[STOR, HOUR] >= 0 #generation from storage
            L[STOR, HOUR] >= 0 #current storage level
            D_stor[STOR, HOUR] >= 0 #consumption from storage
            EX[ZONES, ZONES, HOUR] >= 0 #Exchange between zones
            

Add constraint to account for zonal exchange and zonal energy balance, including all generation types

@constraint(transport_problem, Market_Clearing[zone=ZONES, hour=HOUR],
                     sum(G[disp, hour] for disp in intersect(DISP , PLANT_ZONE[zone]))
                   + sum(G_RES[nondisp, hour] for nondisp in intersect(NONDISP , PLANT_ZONE[zone]))
                   + sum(G_stor[stor, hour] for stor in intersect(STOR , STOR_ZONE[zone]))
                    ==
                    demand[hour, zone]
                   - sum(EX[from_zone, zone, hour] for from_zone in ZONES)
                   + sum(EX[zone, to_zone, hour] for to_zone in ZONES)
                   + sum(D_stor[stor, hour] for stor in intersect(STOR , STOR_ZONE[zone])))
            
c)             
To account for the transmission constraints between the zones, we add the NTC constraint

    @constraint(transport_problem, NTC[to_zone=ZONES, from_zone=ZONES,hour=HOUR],
            EX[from_zone, to_zone, hour] <= ntc[from_zone, to_zone]);
            
            
## Task 3

a) Set ntc to zero via 

ntc *= 0 , no exchange between zones possible
large price differences since differing marginal technologies
highest (constant) price in south, since natural gas always marginal technology
high price volatility especially in north due to lack of storages

b)
one price for all zones, if this was not the case, solution could be improved via trading


c)
#north: in 50% case, more curtailment of wind -> access supply cannot be stored/transmitted
#south: in 50% case load is almost exclusively served by domestice generattion, whereas some gas is substituted with increased transmission capacities

in all cases: price(s) are volatile and increase in times of peak load. when transmissions constraints bind, market splitting occurs.
3a: four separate market, prices very volatile
3b: one integrated market, price is least volatile compared to other scenarios
3c50%: in times where transmission constraints bind, we see up to 4 different prices (market splitting), whereas at some points in time up to three zones (north, west, east) form one market with one price 
3c100%: similar patterns as in 3c50%%. market splitting is less frequent due to higher transmission capacity. price is slighlty less volatile compared to 3c50%.
