- we use weather data on onshore ind, offshore wind and pv over a time period of 32 years from 1985-20165
- this allows us to cover a large set of different weather patterns and get reliable numbers on frequency of occurence
- to the computational cointraints imposed by our multi-regional model set up, data reduction of the high dimensional data set is necessary
- we use the approach described by Nahmmacher et. al to select represtative time slices for each region for VRE infeed. Their approach is advantageous because it allows us to adequately represent regional demand patterns (load duration) and VRE infeed curves as well as the spatial and temporal correlation between them (by Nahmmacher et. al, p. 431)
- from the total of hourly pv and wind values over 32 years, we derive a total of XX time slices. In line with Nahmmacher et. al, we use demand data from one base year (2014) due to data availability and since our main research interest lies in VRE patterns
- this means that we do only consider intra-year and no inter-year demand fluctuations -> mention in discussion section
- each representative time slice is a vector of 24 hourly demand, pv and onshore and offshore wind for each region
- these time slices are derived based on ward's clustering method and the euclidean distance measure. See Nahmmacher et all for details. We also normalize all input time series to their maximum value. In contrast to them, we apply a mixed clustering strategy and improve the solution from Ward's algorithm by  with k means, i.e. by using the centroids from Ward's methods as starting centers. This allows us to reduce the inner cluster variance further since Ward's methods is not guaranteed to find a global optimum due to its stepwise nature. Since we are especially interested in representative time slices with extreme load and VRE patterns, we use the cluster medoids from k means for cluster representation (i.e. in order not to average out extreme values)
