\f0\fs24 \cf0 2. a) \
The dual variable associated with the energy balance tell us the costs producing/consuming one additional unit of electricity at the specific node. This can be equal to the prices obtained from the primal problem if the model set up is chosen in a way that enforces locational marginal prices. \
\
d) In both setups, the resulting prices from the definition and the dual variable are not equivalent for all nodes. The prices are only equal for one node in each price zone, whose marginal price is determining the price for the entire zone because of its binding energy balance. As a results, its dual and defined price coincide. The duals of the other nodes represent the value of a marginal relaxation of the energy balance. In the two zone setup, dual and marginal price lie further apart compared to the for zone setup. At the same time, welfare is higher in the four zone model. This is because the four zone model comes closer to the locational marginal prices.}
